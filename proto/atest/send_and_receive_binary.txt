Client sends binary to server
    Client sends binary    foo
    ${message}=  Server receives binary
    Should be equal   ${message}   foo
    
Server sends binary to client
    Server sends binary   foo
    ${message}=  Client receives binary
    Should be equal   ${message}  foo
    
Multiple clients
    [setup]  Start two udp clients
    Start udp server    ${SERVER}    ${SERVER PORT}   _name=ExampleServer  _protocol=Example
    Connect two clients    ${SERVER PORT}    ${SERVER PORT}
    Client Sends binary    foo   _name=Client_1
    Client Sends binary    bar   _name=Client_2
    Verify server gets from    ${CLIENT}    ${CLIENT 1 PORT}     foo    _name=ExampleServer
    Verify server gets from    ${CLIENT}    ${CLIENT 2 PORT}     bar    _name=ExampleServer

Multiple servers
    [setup]  Start two udp clients
    Start udp server    ${SERVER}    ${SERVER PORT}    _name=Server_1  _protocol=Example
    Start udp server    ${SERVER}    ${SERVER PORT 2}  _name=Server_2  _protocol=Example
    Connect two clients    ${SERVER PORT}    ${SERVER PORT 2}
    Client Sends binary    foo   _name=Client_1
    Client Sends binary    bar   _name=Client_2
    Verify server gets from    ${CLIENT}    ${CLIENT 1 PORT}     foo     _name=Server_1
