*** Test Cases ***
UDP Server uses protocol and receives with pattern validation
    Client Sends hex    0x 01 00 dddd 000c 0000 00000005
    ${msg} =    Server Receives simple request    value:(4|5)
    Should be equal    ${msg.value.hex}    0x00000005

TCP server uses protocol and receives with pattern validation
    [Setup]    Setup protocol, TCP server, and client
    Client Sends simple request
    Server Receives simple request

TCP server receives from two clients with pattern validation
    [Setup]    Define protocol, start tcp server and two clients    Example
    Named client sends simple request    ExampleClient1    value:0xcafebabe
    Named client sends simple request    ExampleClient2    value:0xdeadbeef
    Server Receives simple request from named connection    Connection2    value:0xdeadbeef
    Server Receives simple request from named connection    Connection1    value:0xcafebabe

Server uses protocol and receives with pattern validation failing
    Client Sends hex    0x 01 00 dddd 000c 0000 00000005
    Run keyword and expect error    Value of field value does not match *    Server Receives simple request    value:(4|6)

Server uses protocol and value validation fails
    Client Sends hex    0x 01 00 dddd 000c 0000 cafebabe
    Run keyword and expect error    Value of field value does not match *    Server Receives simple request    value:0xffffff

Char field validation passes
    Client sends charred request
    ${msg} =    Server receives charred request    string_value:foo
    Should be equal    ${msg.string_value.ascii}    foo

Char field validation fails
    Client sends charred request
    Run keyword and expect error    Value of field string_value does not match *    Server receives charred request    string_value:bar

Char field validation passes with pattern
    Client sends charred request
    ${msg} =    Server receives charred request    string_value:(bar|foo)
    Should be equal    ${msg.string_value.ascii}    foo

Server receive and validate separately
    Client Sends simple request
    ${msg}=    Server receives without validation
    Validate message    ${msg}

Client receive and validate separately
    Client sends request and server receives it
    Server Sends simple request
    ${msg}=    Client receives without validation
    Validate message    ${msg}

Client receive and validate fails
    Client sends request and server receives it
    Server Sends simple request
    ${msg}=    Client receives without validation
    Validation fails    ${msg}    Value of field value does not match*    value:0xfeedd00d

Server receive and validate fails
    Client sends simple request
    ${msg}=    Server receives without validation
    Validation fails    ${msg}    Value of field value does not match*    value:0xfeedd00d

Validate fails when trying to validate nonexistent field
    Client sends simple request
    ${msg}=    Server receives without validation
    Validation fails    ${msg}    Unknown fields in ValueRequest foo:0xfeedd00d    foo:0xfeedd00d
