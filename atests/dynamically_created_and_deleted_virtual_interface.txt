*** Test Cases ***
Creating virtual Interface
    When Rammbock allocates first virtual interface dynamically
    Then new virtual interface is created

Deleting interface
    Given Rammbock allocates first virtual interface dynamically
    And new virtual interface is created
    When test case ends
    Then virtual interface is deleted

Creating two dynamically allocated interfaces
    Given Rammbock allocates first virtual interface dynamically
    when Rammbock allocates second virtual interface dynamically
    then two virtual interfaces are created

Deleting two dynamically allocated interfaces
    Given Rammbock allocates first virtual interface dynamically
    and Rammbock allocates second virtual interface dynamically
    and two virtual interfaces are created
    When test case ends
    Then two virtual interfaces are deleted

Creating physical Interface
    When Rammbock is using physical interface
    Then defined physical interface is used in test case.
