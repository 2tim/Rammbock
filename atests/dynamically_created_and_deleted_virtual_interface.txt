As a tester I want to run test cases through dynamically generated virtual interface so that I can simulate multiple network elements.

*** Settings ***
Library  ../src

*** Test Case ***

Creating virtuall Interface   
  When Rammbock is creating virtual interface dynamically
  Then new virtual interface is created

Deleting interface
  Given Rammbock is creating virtual interface dynamically
  And new virtual interface is created
  When test case ends
  Then virtual interface is deleted

Creating two dynamically allocated interfaces
  Given Rammbock is creating virtual interface dynamically
  when Rammbock is creating virtual interface dynamically
  then two virtual interfaces are created

Deleting two dynamically allocated interfaces
  Given Rammbock is creating virtual interface dynamically
  and Rammbock is creating virtual interface dynamically
  and two virtual interfaces are created
  When test case ends
  Then virtual interfaces are deleted
  
  
Creating physical Interface  
  When Rammbock is using physical interface
  Then defined physical interface is used in test case.



*** Keyword ***
Rammbock Given Rammbock is using dynamically allocating interface
   use_interface  TEST1  eth1  1.1.1.1  255.255.255.255

tester starts test case

new virtual interface is created

test case ends

virtual interface is deleted
