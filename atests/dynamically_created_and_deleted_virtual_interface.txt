As a tester I want to run test cases through dynamically generated virtual interface so that I can simulate multiple network elements.

*** Settings ***
Library  ../src

*** Test Case ***
Creating physical Interface  
  When Rammbock is using physical interface
  Then new virtual interface is created

Creating virtuall Interface   
  When Rammbock is using dynamically allocated interface
  Then new virtual interface is created

Deleting interface
  Given Rammbock is using dynamically allocated interface
  And new virtual interface is created
  When test case ends
  Then virtual interface is deleted

*** Keyword ***
Rammbock is using dynamically allocated interfaces
   use_interface  TEST1  eth1 

tester starts test case

new virtual interface is created

test case ends

virtual interface is deleted
