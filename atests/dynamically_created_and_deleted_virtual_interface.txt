As a tester I want to run test cases through dynamically generated virtual interface so that I can simulate multiple network elements.

*** Test Case ***
Creating Interface  
  Given Rammbock is using dynamically allocoted interfaces
  When tester starts test case
  Then new virtual interface is created

Deleting interface
  Given Rammbock is using dynamically allocoted interfaces
  When tester starts test case
  And new virtual interface is created
  And test case ends
  Then virtual interface is deleted
